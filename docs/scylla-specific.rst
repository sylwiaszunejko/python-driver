Scylla Specific Features
========================

Shard Awareness
---------------

**scylla-driver** is shard aware and contains extensions that work with the TokenAwarePolicy supported by Scylla 2.3 and onwards. Using this policy, the driver can select a connection to a particular shard based on the shard's token.
As a result, latency is significantly reduced because there is no need to pass data between the shards.

Details on the scylla cql protocol extensions
https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/blob/master/docs/dev/protocol-extensions.md#intranode-sharding

For using it you only need to enable ``TokenAwarePolicy`` on the ``Cluster``

See the configuration of ``native_shard_aware_transport_port`` and ``native_shard_aware_transport_port_ssl`` on scylla.yaml:
https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/blob/master/docs/dev/protocols.md#cql-client-protocol

.. code:: python

    from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
    from cassandra.policies import TokenAwarePolicy, RoundRobinPolicy

    cluster = Cluster(load_balancing_policy=TokenAwarePolicy(RoundRobinPolicy()))


New Cluster Helpers
-------------------

* ``shard_aware_options``

  Setting it to ``dict(disable=True)`` would disable the shard aware functionally, for cases favoring once connection per host (example, lots of processes connecting from one client host, generating a big load of connections

  Other option is to configure scylla by setting ``enable_shard_aware_drivers: false`` on scylla.yaml.

.. code:: python

    from cassandra.cluster import Cluster

    cluster = Cluster(shard_aware_options=dict(disable=True))
    session = cluster.connect()

    assert not cluster.is_shard_aware(), "Shard aware should be disabled"

    # or just disable the shard aware port logic
    cluster = Cluster(shard_aware_options=dict(disable_shardaware_port=True))
    session = cluster.connect()

* ``cluster.is_shard_aware()``

  New method available on ``Cluster`` allowing to check whether the remote cluster supports shard awareness (bool)

.. code:: python

    from cassandra.cluster import Cluster

    cluster = Cluster()
    session = cluster.connect()

    if cluster.is_shard_aware():
        print("connected to a scylla cluster")

* ``cluster.shard_aware_stats()``

  New method available on ``Cluster`` allowing to check the status of shard aware connections to all available hosts (dict)

.. code:: python

    from cassandra.cluster import Cluster

    cluster = Cluster()
    session = cluster.connect()

    stats = cluster.shard_aware_stats()
    if all([v["shards_count"] == v["connected"] for v in stats.values()]):
        print("successfully connected to all shards of all scylla nodes")


New Error Types
--------------------

* ``SCYLLA_RATE_LIMIT_ERROR`` Error

  The ScyllaDB 5.1 introduced a feature called per-partition rate limiting. In case the (user defined) per-partition rate limit is exceeded, the database will start returning a Scylla-specific type of error: RateLimitReached.

.. code:: python

    from cassandra import RateLimitReached
    from cassandra.cluster import Cluster

    cluster = Cluster()
    session = cluster.connect()
    session.execute("""
        CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS keyspace1 
        WITH replication = {'class': 'NetworkTopologyStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1'}
    """)

    session.execute("USE keyspace1")
    session.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE tbl (pk int PRIMARY KEY, v int) 
        WITH per_partition_rate_limit = {'max_writes_per_second': 1}
    """)

    prepared = session.prepare("""
        INSERT INTO tbl (pk, v) VALUES (?, ?)
    """)
    
    try:
        for _ in range(1000):
            self.session.execute(prepared.bind((123, 456)))
    except RateLimitReached:
        raise


Paging Differences
------------------

ScyllaDB has a built-in 1MB page size limit that Cassandra does not have. This means that even if you set a high ``fetch_size`` (e.g., 10000 rows), ScyllaDB may return fewer rows per page if the total response size exceeds 1MB.

This behavior is particularly noticeable when:

* Working with wide tables (many columns)
* Using ``NumpyProtocolHandler`` where you want large arrays per page
* Columns contain large values (blobs, long strings, etc.)

For example, with a table containing 1000 columns, you might receive only 30-50 rows per page even with ``fetch_size=10000``.

**Workaround:** If you need to receive more rows per page (up to ScyllaDB's 1MB limit), set ``default_fetch_size`` to ``None``:

.. code:: python

    from cassandra.cluster import Cluster
    from cassandra.protocol import NumpyProtocolHandler
    from cassandra.query import tuple_factory

    cluster = Cluster()
    session = cluster.connect(keyspace="mykeyspace")
    session.row_factory = tuple_factory
    session.client_protocol_handler = NumpyProtocolHandler
    session.default_fetch_size = None  # Let ScyllaDB control page sizes

    results = session.execute("SELECT * FROM wide_table")

With ``default_fetch_size = None``, the driver won't request a specific page size, allowing ScyllaDB to fill pages up to its 1MB limit. This results in larger arrays when using ``NumpyProtocolHandler``.

For more details on paging, see :ref:`query-paging`.


Tablet Awareness
----------------

**scylla-driver** is tablet-aware, which means that it is able to parse the `TABLETS_ROUTING_V1` and `TABLETS_ROUTING_V2` extensions to ProtocolFeatures, receive tablet information sent by Scylla in the `custom_payload` part of the `RESULT` message, and utilize it.
Thanks to this, queries to tablet-based tables are still shard-aware.

Tablet version tracking
-----------------------

When the cluster offers it, the driver negotiates ``TABLETS_ROUTING_V2`` in
preference to V1. The negotiation happens per connection, so V2 and V1
connections can coexist in the same cluster; each connection uses whichever
extension its node offers. V2 adds tablet version tracking on top of V1,
invisible to application code.

Every tablet now carries a ``tablet_version`` that
changes whenever its replica set is reconfigured. The driver caches the version
it last saw for each tablet and, on every prepared-statement execution over a V2
connection, appends a single ``tablet_version_block`` byte derived from it. The
server returns updated routing information in the ``custom_payload`` only when
that byte shows the driver's cached view is stale, instead of attaching it to
every response. This keeps the cached routing information fresh while avoiding
the per-response overhead that V1 incurs.

No configuration is required: as with V1, a ``TokenAwarePolicy`` is all that is
needed.

.. note::

   ``TABLETS_ROUTING_V2`` is still experimental: a Scylla node advertises it
   (on the wire as ``TABLETS_ROUTING_V2_EXPERIMENTAL``) only when started with
   the ``strongly-consistent-tables`` experimental feature enabled. A node
   without it offers only ``TABLETS_ROUTING_V1``.


Prepared Statement Metadata Caching (``SCYLLA_USE_METADATA_ID``)
----------------------------------------------------------------

When the ``SCYLLA_USE_METADATA_ID`` extension is negotiated, the driver requests the
server to skip sending full result metadata with each prepared SELECT's EXECUTE
response (the ``skip_meta`` optimization), relying instead on the metadata cached
from the initial ``PREPARE`` call. Without change detection this would be unsafe: if
the table schema changes after a statement is prepared (e.g., a column is added,
removed, or its type is altered), the cached metadata becomes stale — leading to
decoding errors or incorrect data.

ScyllaDB solves this by backporting the ``metadata_id`` mechanism from CQL native
protocol v5 as a v4 extension: ``SCYLLA_USE_METADATA_ID``. When this extension is
negotiated, the server includes a hash of the result metadata in the ``PREPARE``
response. The driver sends this hash back with every ``EXECUTE`` request. If the
schema has changed, the server sets the ``METADATA_CHANGED`` flag and returns the
new metadata hash together with the updated column definitions. The driver
automatically updates its cache and uses the new metadata to decode the current
response — all transparently, with no application code change required.

**Behaviour summary:**

- Automatically negotiated at connection time when the ScyllaDB node supports it.
- ``skip_meta`` is enabled (metadata omitted from EXECUTE responses) only when it
  is safe: the prepared statement must carry both a ``result_metadata_id`` and
  usable cached result metadata from PREPARE, *and* the connection serving the
  request must have negotiated ``SCYLLA_USE_METADATA_ID`` — decided per
  connection when the request is serialized.
- Plain CQL v5 connections are unaffected: the metadata id is part of the native
  v5 EXECUTE frame layout and is still sent, but the driver does not request
  skip-metadata there, so such connections keep receiving full result metadata.
- When a schema change is detected by the server, the driver refreshes both the
  cached column metadata and the metadata hash for that prepared statement so that
  all subsequent executions benefit immediately.
- Statements prepared before the extension was negotiated (e.g., during a rolling
  upgrade) start without a metadata hash, but acquire one automatically: on their
  first execution over a connection with the extension, the driver sends an empty
  hash, the server detects the mismatch and responds with the current hash and
  full metadata, and the driver caches both. Subsequent executions get the
  ``skip_meta`` optimization — no re-prepare or client restart is needed.

**Current scope:** the optimization applies to any prepared statement that has
non-empty cached result columns — in practice, SELECT queries.
UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE statements naturally return no result columns, so
their ``result_metadata`` is always empty and ``skip_meta`` is never set for
them. There is no code-level restriction to SELECT; the behaviour follows
directly from the data.
