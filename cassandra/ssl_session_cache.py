Storage for TLS sessions, so that connections can resume one instead of
performing a full handshake.

The policy around this -- what may be offered to whom, for how long, and what
a handshake hands back -- lives with the connections in
:mod:`cassandra.connection`; what is here is only the keeping of them.
"""

class SSLSessionCache(object):
    """
    A thread-safe, bounded cache of TLS sessions, keyed by TLS peer identity.

    TLS clients can skip the expensive part of a handshake by replaying a
    session established earlier with the same peer (RFC 5077 session tickets
    for TLS 1.2, RFC 8446 pre-shared keys for TLS 1.3).  OpenSSL never does
    this on its own -- the client has to hold on to the session and offer it
    on the next connection -- so the driver keeps one of these caches per
    :class:`~.Cluster` and reuses sessions across every connection it opens,
    most importantly the burst of per-shard connections opened to a node at
    once.

    A cached session is not consumed by being used: the same session can be
    replayed by any number of concurrent connections, and each successful
    handshake stores back whatever the peer handed over -- a fresh session
    where one was issued, otherwise the same one again, which keeps the
    deadline it already had rather than starting a new one.  An entry whose
    lifetime has run out is never handed out again, and is dropped when it
    is looked up or when room is needed; entries otherwise go only by being
    replaced or, once the cache is full, by having been used least
    recently.  A session the server declines for any other reason simply
    results in a full handshake, which is what would have happened anyway.

    Instances are safe to use from multiple threads, and may be shared
    between clusters -- which is what makes sessions outlive the cluster that
    established them, so that a cluster replacing an earlier one resumes
    instead of handshaking in full.  A cache the driver created for a cluster
    lives and dies with it; one supplied to :class:`~.Cluster` belongs to
    whoever supplied it, and the driver removes an entry from it only to
    replace it, because its lifetime ran out, or to make room.  Note that an
    entry keeps the ``SSLContext`` its session was established with alive --
    CPython's ``SSLSession`` holds a reference to it -- so a long-lived cache
    holds the contexts of at most :attr:`max_size` peers.  :meth:`clear` drops
    everything, for a caller that wants them gone sooner.

        already had, rather than starting a new one: its lifetime runs from

        re-stamping a full lifetime on every reuse would let one ticket be
        offered for as long as connections keep being opened.  Resuming below
        TLS 1.3 is exactly that case -- an abbreviated handshake hands back the
        session that was offered, same id and same ticket -- while TLS 1.3
        normally issues a fresh one, which starts its own lifetime.  Comparing
        the two here is what makes the rule hold: what is cached, what the

        cannot answer this on its own; a session id can, and is what tells a

        TLS 1.3 server that resumes without issuing one.

        An id of no length is a case of its own.  RFC 5077 section 3.4 lets a
