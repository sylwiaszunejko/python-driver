TLS session resumption against a real, TLS-enabled Scylla cluster.

The mechanics of resumption are covered by
``tests/unit/test_tls_resumption.py`` against a local TLS server.  What needs
a real cluster is whether the *server* accepts one session offered by several
connections at once, which is the case DRIVER-165 is about: a pool opens one
connection per shard and they all offer the same cached session.
