"""
End-to-end tests for TABLETS_ROUTING_V2 against a V2-capable Scylla build.

Unlike the unit tests in tests/unit/test_tablets.py and tests/unit/test_policies.py,
these tests cross the driver<->server boundary: they validate that the driver
negotiates the extension, parses the server's `tablets-routing-v2` payload with
the correct field layout, and that the tablet_version_block it sends actually
matches the server's encoding.

The whole module is opt-in: the server only advertises the extension when started
with the `strongly-consistent-tables` experimental feature, and it is exchanged on
the wire under the name `TABLETS_ROUTING_V2_EXPERIMENTAL`. When run against a
server that does not advertise it (e.g. a released Scylla), every test is skipped.

    us prove the server-side precedence rules: scylla checks V2 first and only
    falls back to V1 when V2 is not set.
