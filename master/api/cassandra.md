The version of the driver in a tuple format

### cassandra.\_\_version_\_

The version of the driver in a string format

### *class* cassandra.ConsistencyLevel

Spcifies how many replicas must respond for an operation to be considered
a success.  By default, `ONE` is used for all operations.

#### ANY *= 0*

Only requires that one replica receives the write *or* the coordinator
stores a hint to replay later. Valid only for writes.

#### ONE *= 1*

Only one replica needs to respond to consider the operation a success

#### TWO *= 2*

Two replicas must respond to consider the operation a success

#### THREE *= 3*

Three replicas must respond to consider the operation a success

#### QUORUM *= 4*

`ceil(RF/2) + 1` replicas must respond to consider the operation a success

#### ALL *= 5*

All replicas must respond to consider the operation a success

#### LOCAL_QUORUM *= 6*

Requires a quorum of replicas in the local datacenter

#### EACH_QUORUM *= 7*

Requires a quorum of replicas in each datacenter

#### SERIAL *= 8*

For conditional inserts/updates that utilize Cassandra’s lightweight
transactions, this requires consensus among all replicas for the
modified data.

#### LOCAL_SERIAL *= 9*

Like [`SERIAL`](#cassandra.ConsistencyLevel.SERIAL), but only requires consensus
among replicas in the local datacenter.

#### LOCAL_ONE *= 10*

Sends a request only to replicas in the local datacenter and waits for
one response.

added support for protocol-level client-side timestamps (see [`Session.use_client_timestamp`](https://python-driver.docs.scylladb.com/master/api/cassandra/cluster.md#cassandra.cluster.Session.use_client_timestamp)),
serial consistency levels for [`BatchStatement`](https://python-driver.docs.scylladb.com/master/api/cassandra/query.md#cassandra.query.BatchStatement), and an improved connection pool.

#### V4 *= 4*

v4, supported in Cassandra 2.2–>3.x+;
added a number of new types, server warnings, new failure messages, and custom payloads. Details in the
[project docs](https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/trunk/doc/native_protocol_v4.spec)

DSE private protocol v2, supported in DSE 6.0+

#### SUPPORTED_VERSIONS *= (5, 4, 3)*

#### BETA_VERSIONS *= (6,)*

A tuple of all beta protocol versions

#### MIN_SUPPORTED *= 3*

Minimum protocol version supported by this driver.

#### MAX_SUPPORTED *= 5*

name of the aggregate

Ordered list of CQL argument type names comprising the type signature

#### *property* signature

function signature string in the form ‘name([type0[,type1[…]]])’

### *exception* cassandra.DriverException

Base for all exceptions explicitly raised by the driver.

### *exception* cassandra.RequestExecutionException

Base for request execution exceptions returned from the server.

### *exception* cassandra.Unavailable

There were not enough live replicas to satisfy the requested consistency
level, so the coordinator node immediately failed the request without
forwarding it to any replicas.

#### consistency *= None*

The requested [`ConsistencyLevel`](#cassandra.ConsistencyLevel)

#### required_replicas *= None*

The number of replicas that needed to be live to complete the operation

#### alive_replicas *= None*

The number of required replica responses

#### received_responses *= None*

The number of replicas that responded before the coordinator timed out
the operation

### *exception* cassandra.ReadTimeout

A subclass of [`Timeout`](#cassandra.Timeout) for read operations.

This indicates that the replicas failed to respond to the coordinator
node before the configured timeout. This timeout is configured in
`cassandra.yaml` with the `read_request_timeout_in_ms`
and `range_request_timeout_in_ms` options.

#### data_retrieved *= None*

A boolean indicating whether the requested data was retrieved
by the coordinator from any replicas before it timed out the
operation

### *exception* cassandra.WriteTimeout

A subclass of [`Timeout`](#cassandra.Timeout) for write operations.

node before the configured timeout. This timeout is configured in
`cassandra.yaml` with the `write_request_timeout_in_ms`
option.

by the coordinator from any replicas before it timed out the

### *exception* cassandra.AuthenticationFailed

Failed to authenticate.

### *exception* cassandra.OperationTimedOut

The operation took longer than the specified (client-side) timeout
